Attempting to get a license for feature 'Implementation' and/or device 'xczu28dr'
INFO: [Common 17-349] Got license for feature 'Implementation' and/or device 'xczu28dr'
CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-1790] Evaluation License Warning: This design contains one or more evaluation cores that will cease to function after a certain period of time. This design should NOT be used in production systems.

Evaluation cores found in this design:
    IP core 'design_1_polar_0_0' (polar_v1_0_2) was generated using a hardware_evaluation license.
    IP core 'design_1_polar_1_0' (polar_v1_0_2) was generated using a hardware_evaluation license.

Resolution: If a new IP Core license was added, in order for the new license to be picked up, the current netlist needs to be updated by resetting and re-generating the IP output products before bitstream generation.
